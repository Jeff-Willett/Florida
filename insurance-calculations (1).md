  × Value Multiplier 
  × Occupancy Multiplier 
  + Flood Insurance
```

### Example Calculation

**Scenario:** $200K manufactured home, 20+ miles inland, 2002-2012 build, seasonal occupancy

```
Base:         $1,344
Location:     × 1.0   (20+ miles inland)
Age:          × 1.0   (2002-2012)
Value:        × 1.0   ($200K)
Occupancy:    × 1.75  (seasonal)
              -------
Subtotal:     $2,352
Flood:        + $500  (moderate risk)
              -------
TOTAL:        $2,852/year ($238/month)
