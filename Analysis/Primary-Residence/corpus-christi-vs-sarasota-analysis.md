## 3. Property Insurance

### Corpus Christi Insurance
**Wind & Coastal Storm:** Minimal risk (inland, small port)

**Sample Quotes:**
- Standard homeowners policy: $900-1,100/year
- Flood insurance (if required): $300-600/year (for base coverage)
- No hurricane surcharge (inland Gulf Coast, low risk)

### Sarasota Insurance (Reference)
**Wind & Coastal Storm:** Medium-High risk (coastal premium area)
**Flood Risk:** Medium-High (coastal, storm surge zones, bay flooding)
**Base Rate (Primary Residence, 20+ miles inland):** $1,200-2,500/year for manufactured home

**Sample Quotes (20+ miles inland inland):**
- Manufactured home (inland 20+ mi): $1,200-1,800/year
