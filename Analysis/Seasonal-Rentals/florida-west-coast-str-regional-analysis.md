- Only allowed in Tourist Districts or Business Districts
- Monthly rentals only in residential areas
- Business Tax Receipt required
- Cannot advertise for daily/weekly rentals in residential zones

**Verdict: NOT VIABLE FOR STR INVESTMENT**
Unless you purchase commercial/tourist-zoned property (much higher cost), Clearwater is off the table for traditional STR strategy.

**Key Regulations:**
