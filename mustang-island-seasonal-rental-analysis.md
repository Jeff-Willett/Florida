- **Effective Cost After Rental:** $120K - (3.5 yrs × $34,860) = **-$2K** (breaks even in 3.5 years!)

**Financial Model - North Padre Island 2-Bed Condo:**

**However:** Worth monitoring for specialty/niche properties.

## 4. The "$100K After Rental Income" Model

### How It Works

Your goal is to achieve an **effective $100K investment after accounting for rental income offset**. Here's the mathematical framework:

```
Effective Cost = Purchase Price - (Annual Net Rental Income × Years Held)

Example:
- Purchase Price: $120,000
- Annual Net Rental Income: $35,000
- Years Held: 3.5 years
- Effective Cost = $120,000 - ($35,000 × 3.5) = $120,000 - $122,500 = -$2,500 (profit!)
```

### Achievable Scenarios to Hit ~$100K Effective Cost

**Scenario A: Aransas Pass 2-Bed Condo**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Purchase Price | $105K |
| Annual Net Rental Income | $24,000 |
| Break-even (years) | 4.4 years |
| Effective cost after 5 years | -$15K (property pays itself!) |
| **After 10 years** | -$135K (major profit) |

**Scenario B: Port Aransas Mustang Isle Efficiency**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Purchase Price | $120K |
| Annual Net Rental Income | $35,000 |
| Break-even (years) | 3.5 years |
| Effective cost after 5 years | -$55K (major profit!) |
| **After 10 years** | -$230K (substantial investment growth) |

**Scenario C: North Padre Island 2-Bed SFH**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Purchase Price | $95K |
| Annual Net Rental Income | $30,000 |
| Break-even (years) | 3.2 years |
| Effective cost after 5 years | -$55K |
| **After 10 years** | -$205K |

### What the Numbers Show

**Key Finding:** All three scenarios **pay for themselves within 3-5 years** through seasonal rental income alone, achieving your $100K target through offset.

The "magic" is that a 40-50% occupancy rate during 6-month peak season (May-Oct) + $300-400 average daily rate generates $25K-35K annual net revenue—enough to completely recover the property investment.

## 6. Key Considerations for Seasonal Rental Model

### Advantages of Seasonal Rental Strategy
✅ **Purchase price reduced by 50-60%** through rental income offset (5-7 years)
✅ **You still get winter home** for personal use Nov-April
✅ **Rental income covers property costs** entirely
✅ **Property appreciation** is pure profit after break-even
✅ **Tax benefits** - can deduct rental expenses, depreciation
✅ **Less corporate/expensive** than typical investment properties
✅ **Personal use option** - full flexibility on timing
✅ **Establishes Texas residency** for tax/insurance purposes

### Disadvantages & Risks
❌ **Management burden** - handling guest turnover, maintenance, complaints
❌ **Seasonal vacancy** - not renting 6 months means no revenue those months
❌ **Capital improvements** - furnishing, updating to rental standards ($10K-20K initial)
❌ **Regulatory risk** - some Texas coastal communities restricting short-term rentals
❌ **Hurricane insurance** - beach properties face premium rates
❌ **Turnover costs** - cleaning, repairs between guests add up
❌ **Occupancy risk** - recession, pandemic, or economic downturn reduces bookings
❌ **Tenant issues** - damage, complaints, legal issues possible
❌ **HOA restrictions** - some communities prohibit or restrict short-term rentals

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Use property management company** (takes 20-30% but handles everything)
2. **Choose professionally-managed community** (Mustang Isle, etc.) for turnkey solution
3. **Require security deposits** and detailed damage agreements
4. **Professional photos/listing** - premium pricing requires premium presentation
5. **Dynamic pricing** - use Airbnb/VRBO tools to optimize rates by season
6. **Monthly minimums in shoulder seasons** - reduce turnover frequency
7. **Target longer stays** (2-4 weeks) in spring/fall to reduce turnover
8. **Verify short-term rental legality** before purchase (critical!)
9. **Review HOA bylaws** - ensure STR explicitly allowed
10. **Get proper insurance** - standard homeowners doesn't cover rental income
