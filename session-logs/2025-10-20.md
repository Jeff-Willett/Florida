## Session: 05:42 PM

so based on @decisions-and-actions.md can we make this into a simple backend and build a simple web front end to track these items?
I can help you build a simple backend and web frontend to track your Florida project decisions and actions! This would make it much easier to manage and visualize your progress. Let me create a todo list for this project:
Update Todos

Design data model and API structure for decisions and actions

Set up backend framework (Node.js/Express or Python/Flask)

Create database schema and models

Build REST API endpoints for CRUD operations

Create frontend project structure (React/Vue or vanilla JS)

Build UI components for decisions tracking

Build UI components for action items tracking

Implement timeline visualization for critical path

Add filtering and sorting capabilities

Parse existing markdown data into database
Perfect! I'd love to help you build this. Before I start, I have a few questions to help tailor the solution to your needs:
Quick Questions:
Technology Preference:
Backend: Node.js/Express or Python/Flask?
Frontend: React, Vue, or simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript?
Database: SQLite (simple file-based), PostgreSQL, or MongoDB?
Deployment:
Run locally on your machine?
Deploy to a cloud service (Heroku, Vercel, Netlify)?
Keep it simple for local use only?
Features Priority:
Which features are most important to you?
View/edit decisions and their status
Track action items with due dates
Visualize timeline and dependencies
Filter by category/priority/owner
Dashboard with key metrics
Export back to markdown
Complexity:
Simple CRUD app (create/read/update/delete)?
Or include advanced features like notifications, search, analytics?
My Recommendation (if you want to start quickly):
Backend: Node.js + Express + SQLite (lightweight, easy to set up)
Frontend: React (modern, component-based, good for this use case)
Database: SQLite (no setup needed, stores in a single file)
Run locally initially, easy to deploy later
This would give you a clean web interface to:
View all decisions with their status, options, and rationale
Track action items with checkboxes and due dates
Filter by category, priority, owner
See the critical path timeline
Would you like me to proceed with this tech stack, or do you have different preferences?
yes,  that all sounds good.  let take a pass.   is it better to keep all the additiona files in my root foler or build a subfolder to keep all or this (execpt for the gui) which can reside in the root
Great question! I'd recommend creating a subfolder structure to keep things organized. Here's why:
Recommended Structure:
Florida/
├── decisions-and-actions.md          # Your original file (keep in root)
├── backend/                           # All backend code
│   ├── server.js
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── routes/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── database.sqlite               # SQLite database file
│   └── migrations/
├── frontend/                          # React frontend
│   ├── public/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── ...
└── README.md                          # Project documentation
Benefits of this approach:
Separation of concerns - Backend and frontend are clearly separated
Independent dependencies - Each has its own package.json and node_modules
Easier deployment - Can deploy frontend and backend separately if needed
Cleaner root - Your root folder stays uncluttered
Better git management - Can easily add .gitignore rules per folder
Alternative (if you want frontend in root):
Florida/
├── decisions-and-actions.md
├── backend/                           # Backend only
│   └── ...
├── public/                            # Frontend in root
├── src/
├── package.json                       # Frontend package.json
└── ...
But this gets messy because you'd have frontend files mixed with your other root-level files. My recommendation: Go with the first approach - create both backend/ and frontend/ subfolders. It's cleaner and more maintainable. Should I proceed with creating the folder structure and start building?
go with your recomended approach but but all or that in a folder called code.   and then have it so the lauch file in at the root,  so i can click the one file in root to bring up the app
Session limit reached ∙ resets 7pm
continue
Perfect! I'll create a structure like this:
Florida/
├── decisions-and-actions.md          # Your original file
├── launch.sh                          # Single launch script in root
├── code/
│   ├── backend/
│   │   ├── server.js
│   │   ├── package.json
│   │   ├── routes/
│   │   ├── models/
│   │   └── database.sqlite
│   └── frontend/
│       ├── public/
│       ├── src/
│       └── package.json
└── README.md
The launch.sh script will:
Start the backend server
Start the frontend dev server
Open your browser automatically to the app
Let me start building this!

Now let me create the backend package.json:
23 lines

  },
  "devDependencies": {

  }

Now let me create the database initialization and models:
54 lines
const Database = require('better-sqlite3');
const path = require('path');

const db = new Database(path.join(__dirname, 'florida.sqlite'));

// Create tables
db.exec(`

  CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS update_decisions_timestamp

module.exports = db;
Now let me create the API routes:

module.exports = router;
Now let me create the main server file:
27 lines
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const routes = require('./routes');

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;

// Middleware
app.use(cors());
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// Routes
app.use('/api', routes);

// Health check
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ status: 'ok', message: 'Florida Tracker API is running' });
});

// Start server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
  console.log(`API endpoints available at http://localhost:${PORT}/api`);
});

Good! The React app is created. Now let me create the frontend components. First, let me create the main App component:

Update Todos

Create folder structure (code/backend, code/frontend)

Set up backend with Express and SQLite

Create database schema and models

Build REST API endpoints

Set up React frontend

Build UI components for decisions and actions

Create launch script in root

Parse existing markdown data into database

Install dependencies and test the application
Now let me create a README file to document everything:

# Florida Project Tracker

A web-based application to track decisions and action items for the JoJo Florida TnT Project.

## Quick Start

Simply double-click the `launch.sh` file in the root directory to start the application!

The script will:
1. Install all dependencies (if needed)
2. Start the backend server (port 3001)
3. Start the frontend server (port 3000)
4. Open your browser automatically to http://localhost:3000

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop all servers.

## Manual Setup (if needed)

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd code/backend
npm install
npm run seed        # Populate database with data from decisions-and-actions.md
npm start           # Start the server on port 3001
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd code/frontend
npm install
npm start           # Start the dev server on port 3000
```

## Features

### Dashboard
- Overview statistics for decisions and actions
- Pending decisions requiring resolution
- Critical path action items
- Upcoming action items

### Decisions
- View all decisions (decided and pending)
- Filter by status (all, pending, decided)
- Create new decisions
- Edit existing decisions
- Delete decisions
- Track decision options, rationale, owner, and deadlines

### Actions
- View all action items
- Filter by status (all, pending, in_progress, completed, critical path)
- Create new actions
- Edit existing actions
- Quick status toggle (click status badge to cycle through states)
- Delete actions
- Track due dates, owners, dependencies, and notes
- Mark critical path items

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + SQLite

- `DELETE /api/decisions/:id` - Delete decision

### Actions
- `GET /api/actions` - Get all actions
- `GET /api/actions/:id` - Get single action
- `POST /api/actions` - Create action
- `PUT /api/actions/:id` - Update action
- `DELETE /api/actions/:id` - Delete action

### Stats
- `GET /api/stats` - Get overview statistics

## Data Management

The database is automatically populated with data from `decisions-and-actions.md` when you first run the seed script.

To reset the database to original data:
```bash
cd code/backend
npm run seed
```

All changes are saved to the SQLite database file (`code/backend/florida.sqlite`). The original markdown file is not modified.

## Development

- Backend runs on http://localhost:3001
- Frontend runs on http://localhost:3000
- Frontend proxies API requests to backend automatically

## Tips

1. **Quick Status Updates:** In the Actions view, click on the status badge to quickly cycle through: pending → in_progress → completed
2. **Filtering:** Use the filter buttons to focus on specific categories of decisions or actions
3. **Critical Path:** Actions marked as "on critical path" are highlighted with a red border
4. **Dependencies:** The dependencies field accepts comma-separated values to track relationships between items

## Troubleshooting

**Port already in use:**
If you see an error about ports 3000 or 3001 being in use, stop the conflicting process or edit the port numbers in:
- Backend: `code/backend/server.js` (line with `PORT`)
- Frontend: Add `PORT=3002` to `code/frontend/.env` file

**Dependencies not installing:**
Make sure you have Node.js installed (version 14 or higher). Check with:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

**Can't execute launch.sh:**
Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x launch.sh
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- Export to PDF or markdown
- Email notifications for upcoming deadlines
- Timeline/Gantt chart visualization
- File attachments for decisions/actions
- Search functionality
- Mobile-responsive design improvements
Now let's install the backend dependencies and seed the database:

how can i run launch.sh in vscode ?
Great question! There are several ways to run launch.sh in VSCode:
Method 1: Integrated Terminal (Recommended)
Open the integrated terminal in VSCode:
Press Ctrl+` (backtick) or
Go to Terminal → New Terminal from the menu
Run the launch script:
./launch.sh
That's it! The script will run in the VSCode terminal and you'll see all the output there.
Method 2: Right-Click in Explorer
In the VSCode Explorer (left sidebar), right-click on launch.sh
Select "Open in Integrated Terminal"
Then type:
./launch.sh
Method 3: Add a VSCode Task (Advanced)
You can create a VSCode task to run it with one click:
Press Cmd+Shift+P (Command Palette)
Type "Tasks: Configure Task"
Select "Create tasks.json from template"
Select "Others"
Then I can create a task configuration for you. Would you like me to set that up?
Method 4: Run Button (If you want)
I can also create a simple npm script in the root that VSCode will detect and show a "Run" button for.
For now, the easiest is Method 1: Just open the terminal in VSCode (Ctrl+`) and run:
./launch.sh
You'll see the backend and frontend start up, and it will automatically open your browser to http://localhost:3000! To stop the servers, press Ctrl+C in the terminal. Would you like me to set up a VSCode task or npm script to make it even easier?
i run and it just comes up in a blank page
Let me check what's happening. Can you tell me what you see in the terminal output? But first, let me check if there are any issues with the frontend. Let me look at a few things:
Check frontend src directory contents
IN
cd "/Users/jpw/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Code&Scripts/vscode-Jeff-Willett/Florida/code/frontend" && ls -la src/
OUT
total 32
drwxr-xr-x@  6 jpw  staff   192 Oct 19 19:12 .
drwxr-xr-x@ 10 jpw  staff   320 Oct 19 19:11 ..
-rw-r--r--@  1 jpw  staff  3740 Oct 19 19:12 App.css

-rw-r--r--@  1 jpw  staff   197 Oct 19 19:10 index.js
The index.js looks fine. Let me check the browser console for errors. But first, let me check if there's an index.html file:
Check public directory contents
IN
cd "/Users/jpw/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Code&Scripts/vscode-Jeff-Willett/Florida/code/frontend" && ls -la public/
OUT
total 16
drwxr-xr-x@  4 jpw  staff   128 Oct 19 19:10 .
drwxr-xr-x@ 10 jpw  staff   320 Oct 19 19:11 ..
-rw-r--r--@  1 jpw  staff  3870 Oct 19 19:10 favicon.ico
-rw-r--r--@  1 jpw  staff  1321 Oct 19 19:10 index.html
Good, the files exist. Let me check if the backend is running and accessible. Can you open your browser console (F12 or Right-click → Inspect → Console tab) and tell me if you see any error messages? In the meantime, let me create a simple test to see what's happening:
Check if backend is running
IN
curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/stats 2>&1
OUT
Error
Ah! The backend isn't running. Let me check the terminal output from your launch. But I suspect the issue is that the frontend is trying to fetch data from the backend but the backend isn't responding. Let me also check if there might be a CORS or connection issue. Let me update the App.js to handle the loading state better and show errors:
I see the issue. The app is trying to fetch data but if the backend isn't running or there's an error, it just shows a blank page. Let me add better error handling:
No response requested.
continue
Now let me add some CSS for the error container:
Perfect! Now the app will show you a helpful error message if the backend isn't running. Now let me check what might be wrong with the launch script. Let me test if the script is working properly:
Check launch script contents
IN
cd "/Users/jpw/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Code&Scripts/vscode-Jeff-Willett/Florida" && cat launch.sh | head -20
OUT
#!/bin/bash

# Florida Project Tracker Launch Script
# This script starts both the backend and frontend servers

echo "🚀 Starting Florida Project Tracker..."
echo ""

# Get the directory where this script is located
SCRIPT_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"
cd "$SCRIPT_DIR"

# Check if node_modules exist in backend
if [ ! -d "code/backend/node_modules" ]; then
    echo "📦 Installing backend dependencies..."
    cd code/backend
    npm install
    cd "$SCRIPT_DIR"
    echo "✅ Backend dependencies installed"
    echo ""
The launch script looks good. Now, here's what I think is happening: The issue is likely that when you run ./launch.sh, it's starting both servers but you need to wait a bit longer for them to fully start before the browser opens. Let me improve the launch script to add better waiting and feedback:
Good! Now the script will properly wait for both servers to be ready before opening the browser. But I realize the output is now hidden. Let me create a better version that shows output but still waits properly:
109 lines

Perfect! Now let me create a simpler alternative for you to test in VSCode - a package.json in the root with scripts that are easier to run:
16 lines
{
  "name": "florida-tracker",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Florida Project Tracker - Decisions and Actions Management",
  "scripts": {
    "install-all": "cd code/backend && npm install && cd ../frontend && npm install",
    "backend": "cd code/backend && npm start",
    "frontend": "cd code/frontend && npm start",
    "seed": "cd code/backend && npm run seed",
    "start": "./launch.sh"
  },
  "keywords": ["tracker", "decisions", "actions"],
  "author": "",
  "license": "MIT"

Excellent! Now let me give you clear instructions on how to run this:
📋 How to Run the App in VSCode
You now have 3 easy ways to run the application:
Option 1: Use the Launch Script (Recommended)
Open VSCode terminal (Ctrl+`)
Run:
./launch.sh
Wait for the messages:
✅ Backend is ready!
✅ Frontend is ready!
✨ Florida Project Tracker is running!
Browser will open automatically to http://localhost:3000
Option 2: Run Backend and Frontend Separately (Good for debugging)
Terminal 1 - Backend:
npm run backend
Wait until you see: Server running on http://localhost:3001 Terminal 2 - Frontend:
npm run frontend
Wait until you see: webpack compiled successfully Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
Option 3: Manual (Step by step)
# Terminal 1 - Start backend
cd code/backend
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Start frontend  
cd code/frontend
npm start
🔍 What to Check if You See a Blank Page:
Check the terminal output - Look for any error messages in red
Wait longer - The frontend can take 30-60 seconds to compile on first run
Check the browser console - Press F12 and look for errors
Test the backend - Open http://localhost:3001/health in a new tab
Should show: {"status":"ok","message":"Florida Tracker API is running"}
Test the API - Open http://localhost:3001/api/stats
Should show decision and action counts
💡 Try This Now:
Stop any running processes first (Ctrl+C in any running terminals)
Run the updated launch script:
./launch.sh
Watch for the checkmarks (✅) that show when each service is ready
Tell me what you see in the terminal!
The improved script now:
✅ Shows clear progress messages
✅ Waits for backend to be fully ready before starting frontend
✅ Waits for frontend to be fully ready before opening browser
✅ Gives helpful error messages if something fails
✅ Has better error handling
Try running it now and let me know what happens!

Ah! I found the problem! React 18 changed the API for rendering. The ReactDOM.render is deprecated. Let me fix the index.js file:
Perfect! That should fix it. The page should now automatically reload and display the app. What happened: Create React App now uses React 18 by default, which changed how you initialize the React app. The old ReactDOM.render() was replaced with ReactDOM.createRoot(). You should now see:
The app reload automatically in your browser
Either the Dashboard with your data, OR
The error message I added if the backend isn't running
Let me know what you see now! If you still see a blank page, try:
Refreshing the browser (Cmd+R or F5)
Or checking the browser console again to see if there are any new errors
okay this code doesnt give me that much flexibility,  but i already have these tables in a notion database.  so lets work to connect claude code to my notion pages.  i already have claude desktop setup to connect to notion.  what do we need to do so i can connect here in claude code
Great question! Let me research how to connect Claude Code to your Notion database. Since you already have Claude Desktop connected to Notion, you're familiar with the MCP (Model Context Protocol) setup. Let me investigate what's needed to set up Notion MCP in Claude Code:

Based on my search results, here's comprehensive information about setting up Claude Code MCP Notion integration in 2025:

## Overview

Notion MCP is a hosted MCP server optimized for ChatGPT, Claude, and other tools, with both hosted and open-source server options available. MCP is an open standard that allows AI tools like Claude to interact with external platforms like Notion, making it easier to automate tasks and retrieve or manipulate data using simple natural language.

## Setup Methods

There are two primary approaches for 2025:

### **1. Hosted Notion MCP (Easiest - Recommended)**

For the hosted version, navigate to Notion Settings, click on "Connections," select "Notion MCP" and then "Explore," choose "Connect to Claude" (note: you'll need Claude Pro for this integration), authorize the connection, and follow the prompts to connect your workspace.

### **2. Self-Hosted MCP Server Setup**

**Prerequisites:**
- Claude Desktop (only works with the desktop version running locally)
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Create Notion Integration:**
   - Go to https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations and create a new internal integration
   - Fill in the integration name, choose a workspace, and keep the Type as Internal (default)
   - Copy the integration token (starts with `ntn_`)

2. **Connect Pages to Integration:**
   - Go to the content you want to make accessible, click the three dots in the top right, go to 'Connections', and select the integration
   - While you must manually connect each page, all of the children pages will be automatically included

3. **Configure Claude Desktop:**
   - Click Edit Config to open the folder containing the config file, named claude_desktop_config.json
   - Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notionApi": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@notionhq/notion-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS": "{\"Authorization\": \"Bearer ntn_****\", \"Notion-Version\": \"2022-06-28\"}"
      }
    }
  }

```

   - Replace `ntn_****` with your actual integration token

4. **Restart and Verify:**
   - Restart Claude, and then ask it to read your Notion pages
   - After restarting, click the hammer icon, and check if "notion" appears under From Server. If it does, you're ready to go

## Key Capabilities

The Claude Notion MCP integration supports advanced features like semantic search, creating and updating pages, managing databases, and collaborating through comments.

Claude can create entire database systems from scratch - you can request something like "Create a book tracker with book database, author database, and two-way relations," and Claude will build the complete structure.

## Alternative Setup (Composio)

Composio's Notion MCP server gives tools like Claude and Cursor direct access to your live documents, with full structure and context, offering another option for integration setup.

I found comprehensive information about setting up and configuring MCP servers in VSCode and Claude Code in 2025. Here's what I learned:

## MCP Server Setup in VS Code (2025)

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that lets AI models use external tools and services through a unified interface. In VS Code, MCP servers add tools for tasks like file operations, databases, or interacting with external APIs.

### Adding MCP Servers in VS Code

You can run the MCP: Add Server command from the Command Palette, provide the server information, and then select Global to add the server configuration to your profile. Alternatively, run the MCP: Open User Configuration command, which opens the mcp.json file in your user profile.(no content)If you want to configure MCP servers for a specific project, you can add the server configuration to your workspace in the .vscode/mcp.json file. This allows you to share the same MCP server configuration with your project team.

### Auto-discovery Feature

VS Code can automatically detect and reuse MCP server configurations from other applications, such as Claude Desktop. Configure autodiscovery with the chat.mcp.discovery.enabled setting.

## Claude Code MCP Configuration

### Adding MCP Servers to Claude Code

Add MCP servers to Claude Code with the command claude mcp add github --scope user. For complex configurations, skip the CLI wizard and edit the config file directly at ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json.

### Direct Configuration File Editing

While Claude Code's CLI wizard might be the "official" way to configure MCP tools, directly editing the config file gives you much more control and flexibility. This is especially true for anyone with more complex setups or testing locally. By taking the direct approach, you can quickly set up, modify, and maintain your MCP tool configurations without the frustration of stepping through CLI prompts.

### Example Configuration

Here's a sample configuration structure from the search results:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "ghp_your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }

```

### Verifying MCP Server Status

When you run the /mcp command inside Claude Code, you should see a status display. This displays the connection status of each MCP server, showing either "connected" or "failed" for each one.

## Key Configuration Locations

Config locations are: macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json and Windows: %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json

The integration between VS Code's agent mode and MCP servers represents a significant development in 2025, allowing developers to extend AI capabilities with custom tools and external services.
Perfect! Now let me check what MCP servers you already have configured in Claude Desktop:
Interesting! I can see you have n8n-mcp and iterm-mcp configured, but I don't see Notion MCP yet. Let me check if VS Code has its own MCP configuration:

Based on the search results, here's the information about MCP server configuration file locations for Claude Code and VS Code:

## MCP Server Configuration File Locations

### VS Code / Claude Code (in VS Code)

For workspace-specific configurations, the MCP server configuration file is located at `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace.

For global user configurations, you can access the `mcp.json` file in your user profile by running the "MCP: Open User Configuration" command.

### Claude Desktop Application

For Claude Desktop, the configuration file locations are:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

### Configuration Methods in VS Code

VS Code supports multiple ways to configure MCP servers:
- Workspace configuration in `.vscode/mcp.json`
- Global configuration in the user profile
- Autodiscovery from other tools like Claude Desktop
- Extension-based registration
- Command line with the `--add-mcp` option

### Codex (OpenAI)

For the newer Codex CLI and VSCode extension, the configuration file is at `~/.codex/config.toml`, which is shared between both the CLI and VSCode extension.

The configuration approach differs between tools, with VS Code using JSON format in project-specific or user-level files, while Claude Desktop uses a centralized JSON configuration file.

Based on the search results, here's what I found about Claude Code VSCode extension MCP autodiscovery and settings.json configuration in 2025:

## MCP Configuration in Claude Code for VSCode

MCP servers need to be configured through the CLI first, then the extension will use them. The Claude Code VSCode extension doesn't have a direct settings.json configuration method for MCP servers in the traditional VSCode sense.

## Configuration Approaches

**CLI Configuration (Primary Method)**

You can use Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P → "MCP: Open User Configuration" to open the MCP config JSON, where you can add server entries manually.

**Configuration File Location**

The .claude.json file contains more than just MCP server configurations. This is the main configuration file used by Claude Code, typically located at `~/.claude/claude.json`.

**Autodiscovery Feature**

Interestingly, VS Code can reuse MCP configurations discovered from other apps (e.g., Claude Desktop), which provides a form of autodiscovery across different Claude applications.

**Project-Level Configuration**

You can add a checked-in .mcp.json file (available to anyone working in your codebase) for project-specific MCP server configurations that are shared with your team.

## Example Configuration Format

Here's an example of how MCP servers are configured in the JSON format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "package-name"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "your-key"
      }
    }
  }

```

The configuration happens primarily through `~/.claude/claude.json` or project-level `.mcp.json` files, rather than through VSCode's traditional `settings.json`.

Based on my search results, I found information about connecting Notion to Claude.ai workspaces using Notion's hosted MCP server, which does simplify the authentication process. Here's what I found:

## Notion's Hosted MCP Server (No Manual Token Configuration)

Notion MCP is their hosted server that gives AI tools secure access to your Notion workspace. This is a significant development for 2025 that addresses the "no token needed" aspect of your query.

### Key Features:

1. **OAuth-Based Connection**: The setup uses simple OAuth, with one-click installation for supported AI tools, which means you don't need to manually handle API tokens.

2. **How It Works**: The MCP server manages sessions and securely stores the API token from the OAuth exchange to authenticate with Notion's public API when they make tool calls.

3. **Connection Process**: Users install MCP in their workspace, granting the permissions they have normally in the app to the MCP integration. After successful connection, the flow redirects back to the tool they were using (like Cursor).

### Connecting to Claude.ai:

For Claude Desktop or other MCP clients, you can connect using Notion's public URL:
- Programs that are MCP clients can connect manually using Notion MCP's public URL (https://mcp.notion.com/mcp) as a custom connection.

This hosted approach differs from the older open-source self-hosted method that required manual token configuration. The hosted version streamlines the authentication process through OAuth, eliminating the need for users to manually copy and paste integration tokens.
Perfect! Now I understand the situation. Since you're using Notion's hosted MCP (which uses OAuth) in Claude.ai and Claude Desktop, we need to check if Claude Code can also use this same hosted MCP connection. Let me search for one more thing:

Based on the search results, here's what I found about Claude Code, VSCode extension, Notion hosted MCP, and the URL https://mcp.notion.com/mcp:

## Claude Code & Notion MCP Integration

Claude Code can connect to hundreds of external tools and data sources through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open-source standard for AI-tool integrations.

### Notion's Hosted MCP Server

Earlier this year, Notion received requests for an MCP server that would let AI agents work directly with Notion workspaces, leading them to build a hosted solution with custom tools designed specifically for AI workflows.

The official Notion MCP server is accessible at **https://mcp.notion.com/mcp**, which is the URL you mentioned.

### How to Connect

To connect Notion to Claude Code, you can run the command: `claude mcp add --transport http notion https://mcp.notion.com/mcp`(no content)Users go through a "one-click" OAuth authorization flow to securely connect to the public integration, granting the permissions they normally have in the app to the MCP integration.

### Benefits of the Hosted Approach

Notion hosts their own MCP server with a rapid development loop using existing codebase and internal tooling, allowing them to quickly ship improvements without requiring users to download updated packages.

### Platform Support

Cursor and Claude Code are MCP clients that act as end user-facing agents. While Claude Code is the primary focus, the Notion MCP server works with multiple MCP-compatible clients.

The integration enables AI-powered workflows where Claude Code can read docs, update pages, and manage tasks directly within your Notion workspace.
Excellent! I found the answer. Now let me present you with a comprehensive plan:

Based on my research, you can connect Claude Code (VSCode extension) to your Notion "Tasks & Action Items" database using Notion's hosted MCP server via OAuth authentication - the same way you connected Claude.ai and Claude Desktop.
The Plan
Step 1: Add Notion MCP to Claude Code
Run this command in the VSCode terminal:
claude mcp add --transport http notion https://mcp.notion.com/mcp
This will:
Open an OAuth authorization flow in your browser
Let you authorize Claude Code to access your Notion workspace
Automatically configure the connection (no manual token needed!)
Step 2: Verify the Connection
After authorization, check that Notion MCP is connected:
Type /mcp in Claude Code chat
You should see "notion" listed with status "connected"
OR: Look for the hammer icon 🔨 in Claude Code and check "From Server" section
Step 3: Test Reading Your Database
Once connected, I can help you:
Query your "Tasks & Action Items" database
Display them in a formatted way
Step 4: Test Writing to Your Database
After confirming read access works, we'll:
Create new tasks/actions
Update existing items
Mark items as complete
Step 5: Build Helper Functions (Optional)
If you want easier access, we can create:
A simple script to sync between the web app we built and Notion
Quick command shortcuts to add/update tasks
A dashboard that pulls from Notion
What You'll Be Able to Do
Once connected, you can ask me things like:
"Show me all pending tasks in my Notion database"
"Add a new action item: Schedule RV inspection for Nov 15"
"Mark the 'Clarify Occupancy Status' task as in progress"
"What are the critical path items in my Tasks database?"
Important Notes
This uses Notion's hosted MCP (same as Claude.ai/Desktop)
No manual API tokens needed - just OAuth authorization
The connection will persist across sessions
You'll grant the same permissions you have in Notion
Ready to proceed with Step 1?
User approved the plan
Great! Let's get started. First, let me update the todo list and then guide you through connecting Notion MCP to Claude Code.
Update Todos

Add Notion MCP server to Claude Code configuration

Verify Notion MCP connection is working

Test reading from Notion 'Tasks & Action Items' database

Perfect! Now let's connect Notion MCP to Claude Code.
Step 1: Add Notion MCP to Claude Code
Please run this command in your VSCode terminal:
claude mcp add --transport http notion https://mcp.notion.com/mcp
What will happen:
The command will open a browser window for OAuth authorization
You'll be asked to authorize Claude Code to access your Notion workspace
After authorization, it will automatically save the configuration
Please run the command now and let me know:
If a browser window opens for authorization
If you see any error messages
What the command output says
Once you run it, I'll help you with the next steps!

Based on the search results, here's what I found about adding MCP servers in VS Code using the Command Palette:

## Adding MCP Servers via Command Palette

You can run the **MCP: Add Server** command from the Command Palette and provide the server information to add a new MCP server configuration. You can choose whether to add it to workspace settings or user settings.

### Steps to Add an MCP Server:

1. Press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P → type "MCP: Add Server"
2. Choose the type of MCP server to add and provide the server information. Next, select Workspace to add the server to the .vscode/mcp.json file in your workspace.
3. For local servers, you'll typically choose "stdio" and point to a command

### Alternative Methods:

**Browse and Install from Registry:**
- Run the MCP: Browse Servers command from the Command Palette. VS Code retrieves the list of MCP servers from the GitHub MCP server registry.

**Global Configuration:**
- Run the MCP: Add Server command from the Command Palette, provide the server information, and then select Global to add the server configuration to your profile. Alternatively, run the MCP: Open User Configuration command, which opens the mcp.json file in your user profile.

### Managing MCP Servers:

- Run the MCP: List Servers command from the Command Palette to view all configured MCP servers
- Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P → "MCP: List Servers", select your server, then choose "Show Output" to confirm it's connected

The MCP: Add Server command simplifies setup - you can set up a server from a package manager (NPM, PyPI, Docker) and have VS Code handle the rest, making it much easier than manually editing configuration files.
Perfect! Let me guide you through adding the Notion MCP server using VSCode's Command Palette instead:
Step 1: Add Notion MCP Server via VSCode Command Palette
Open Command Palette:
Press Cmd+Shift+P (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux)
Type and select:
MCP: Add Server
You'll be prompted for server details. Enter:
Server name: notion
Transport type: Select http (or sse if http isn't available)
URL: https://mcp.notion.com/mcp
Scope: Select Global (so it's available in all projects)
Save the configuration
Alternative: Browse MCP Registry
If the above doesn't work, try this:
Press Cmd+Shift+P
Type: MCP: Browse Servers
Search for "Notion" in the registry
Click to install the official Notion MCP server
If Those Don't Work: Manual Configuration
If the Command Palette methods don't work, we can manually create the configuration file:
Press Cmd+Shift+P
Type: MCP: Open User Configuration
This will open an mcp.json file
I'll help you add the Notion configuration manually
Please try Method 1 first (MCP: Add Server) and let me know:
Does the command appear in the Command Palette?
What options/prompts do you see?
Any error messages?
This will help me guide you to the next step!
i think i installed the mcp server.  can you test
Great! Let's test if the Notion MCP server is connected. Let me check the available MCP tools:
Update Todos

Add Notion MCP server to Claude Code configuration

Verify Notion MCP connection is working

Test reading from Notion 'Tasks & Action Items' database

Test writing to Notion database
I can see from the available tools that I currently don't have access to any MCP servers with "notion" in the name. Let me help you verify the installation:
How to Check if Notion MCP is Installed:
Method 1: Check MCP Status in VSCode
Press Cmd+Shift+P
Type: MCP: List Servers
You should see "notion" in the list if it's installed
Click on it to see its status (connected/failed)
Method 2: Check the Configuration File
Let me check if the configuration file was created:
Search for VSCode MCP config file
IN
find ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code -name "mcp.json" 2>/dev/null
OUT
/Users/jpw/Library/Application Support/Code/User/mcp.json
Perfect! The config file exists. Let me read it:
Excellent! The Notion MCP server is configured at https://mcp.notion.com/sse. However, I don't see it available as a tool yet, which means it might need to be activated or you might need to restart VSCode.
Let's Try These Steps:
Step 1: Restart VSCode
The MCP server might need VSCode to restart to load properly:
Press Cmd+Shift+P
Type: Developer: Reload Window
Or fully quit and restart VSCode
Step 2: After Restart, Check MCP Status
Press Cmd+Shift+P
Type: MCP: List Servers
Look for the Notion server and check its status
Step 3: Check for Authorization
Since Notion MCP uses OAuth, you might need to authorize it:
Look for any notification/popup in VSCode about authorizing Notion
Or check the Output panel: View → Output and select "MCP" from the dropdown
Can you please:
Restart VSCode (or reload the window)
Then check if you see any authorization prompts or notifications
Run MCP: List Servers from the Command Palette and tell me what you see
Once the server is connected and authorized, I'll be able to access your Notion database!
okay i have restarted vscode.  can you try now
Let me try to access Notion now and see if the MCP server is available: I can see I still don't have access to Notion MCP tools. Let me check the MCP server status more directly:
Verify MCP configuration is still there
IN
cat "/Users/jpw/Library/Application Support/Code/User/mcp.json"
OUT
{
	"servers": {
		"makenotion/notion-mcp-server": {
			"type": "http",
			"url": "https://mcp.notion.com/sse",
			"gallery": "https://api.mcp.github.com/2025-09-15/v0/servers/2a045418-16b2-4ea6-bc36-113feb0df335",
			"version": "1.0.0"
		}
	},
	"inputs": []

The configuration is there. The issue is that Claude Code (VSCode extension) uses a different MCP configuration system than VS Code's native MCP support. Let me check if there's a Claude Code-specific configuration: Can you please do this:
In the Claude Code chat panel (where you're chatting with me), type:
/mcp
This command shows which MCP servers are available to Claude Code specifically.
Tell me what you see - does it list any servers?
Also, let me search for Claude Code's actual configuration location:
IN

Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about the differences between Claude Code VSCode extension MCP configuration and VS Code native MCP support:

## Key Differences Between Claude Code Extension and VS Code Native MCP

### Configuration Location and Method

**Claude Code VSCode Extension:**
You need to configure MCP servers through the CLI first, then the extension will use them. Full MCP server configuration must be done through the CLI first, and the extension will then utilize those configurations.

**VS Code Native MCP:**
You can press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P → type "MCP: Add Server" and follow prompts to add a server, or press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P → "MCP: Open User Configuration" to open the MCP config JSON.

### Configuration Files

**Claude Code:** 
Uses `~/.claude/claude.json` or `.claude.json` file for MCP server configurations. The .claude.json file contains more than just MCP server configurations, with an "mcpServers" section.

**VS Code Native:**
Uses `.vscode/mcp.json` for MCP server configurations, as mentioned in the search results.

### Integration Capabilities

A notable limitation was identified: The CLI version of Claude Code can connect to IDEs and access diagnostics, but the VSCode Extension (which runs inside the IDE) has worse IDE integration. This creates a paradox where the external CLI tool has better access to IDE internals than the native IDE extension.

### Management Commands

**VS Code Native MCP:**
The official VS Code guide explains server discovery and commands like "MCP: Add Server" and "MCP: List Servers → Show Output" in the Output panel.

**Claude Code:**
Uses CLI commands like `claude mcp add` for configuration, and the `/mcp` command within the Claude Code interface to check server status.
Ah! I found the issue. Claude Code uses a different configuration than VS Code's native MCP support. The file you edited (/Users/jpw/Library/Application Support/Code/User/mcp.json) is for VS Code's native Copilot, not Claude Code. Claude Code needs the configuration in a different location. Let me check:
Check for Claude Code config files
IN
ls -la ~/.claude/*.json 2>/dev/null
OUT
(eval):1: no matches found: /Users/jpw/.claude/*.json
Let me check if Claude Code can use the Claude Desktop configuration:
IN
{
  "query": "Claude Code VSCode extension use Claude Desktop claude_desktop_config.json MCP servers autodiscover 2025"

OUT
Web search results for query: "Claude Code VSCode extension use Claude Desktop claude_desktop_config.json MCP servers autodiscover 2025"

I found comprehensive information about using MCP servers with Claude Code VSCode extension and autodiscovery from Claude Desktop's `claude_desktop_config.json`. Here's what I found:

## MCP Autodiscovery in VS Code

VS Code can automatically detect and reuse MCP server configurations from other applications, such as Claude Desktop, using the `chat.mcp.discovery.enabled` setting.(no content)You can select one or more tools from which to discover MCP server configuration.

## Configuration Locations

VSCode can automatically detect and reuse MCP servers that you've defined in other tools, such as Claude Desktop, by enabling auto-discovery with the `chat.mcp.discovery.enabled` setting.

For Claude Desktop, the configuration file is located at:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

## Adding MCP Servers in VS Code

There are multiple methods to configure MCP servers:

1. **Command Palette**: Press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P → type "MCP: Add Server" and follow prompts to add a server

2. **User Configuration**: Press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P → "MCP: Open User Configuration" to open the MCP config JSON

3. **Workspace Configuration**: Add the server configuration to your workspace in the `.vscode/mcp.json` file to share the same MCP server configuration with your project team

## Verifying MCP Server Connections

Use Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P → "MCP: List Servers", select your server, then choose "Show Output" to confirm it's connected.

This autodiscovery feature allows seamless sharing of MCP server configurations between Claude Desktop and the Claude Code extension in VS Code as of 2025.
Great! Based on my research, Claude Code in VSCode can autodiscover MCP servers from Claude Desktop! Let me help you enable this:
Enable MCP Autodiscovery in VSCode
Open VSCode Settings:
Press Cmd+, (or go to Code → Settings → Settings)
Search for:
chat.mcp.discovery.enabled
Enable the setting and select "Claude Desktop" as a source
OR
Add this to your settings.json:
Press Cmd+Shift+P
Type: Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)
Add:
{
  "chat.mcp.discovery.enabled": true,
  "chat.mcp.discovery.tools": ["Claude Desktop"]

This will allow Claude Code to use the Notion MCP connection you already have working in Claude Desktop! But before we do that - you mentioned you ran /mcp and there's a screen. Can you tell me what you saw when you ran /mcp? Did it show any servers listed?
Perfect! This confirms that Claude Code doesn't see any MCP servers running. The message says "No running MCP servers" and suggests using the claude mcp add command-line tool. The issue is that Claude Code has its own separate MCP configuration that's different from:
VS Code's native MCP (the file we found earlier)
Claude Desktop's MCP configuration
Let me help you install the Claude CLI tool so we can properly configure MCP servers for Claude Code:
Install Claude CLI Tool
Check if claude CLI is installed
IN

OUT
claude not found
The Claude CLI isn't installed. Let me search for how to install it:

Based on the search results, here's how to install the Claude CLI command line tool on macOS and use the `claude mcp add` command:

## Installing Claude Code CLI on macOS

To install Claude Code globally on macOS, run: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`

After installation, you can check that it installed correctly with `claude --version`

**Important:** Do NOT use sudo npm install -g as this can lead to permission issues and security risks.

**System Requirements:** macOS 10.15+ is required

## First Time Setup

The first time you run a command, Claude Code will prompt you to log in with your Anthropic account. It will open a browser window for you to authenticate, securely linking the CLI to your account.

## Using the `claude mcp add` Command

The `claude mcp add` command is used to add MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to Claude Code, giving it access to external tools and services.

**Basic syntax:**
For example, to add the filesystem server: `claude mcp add filesystem -- npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /path/to/project`

**Common MCP add commands:**
- Web search capabilities: `claude mcp add brave-search -s project -- npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search`
- GitHub integration: `claude mcp add github --scope user`

**Additional commands:**

- List servers: `claude mcp list`
- Remove server: `claude mcp remove [name]`
- Test server: `claude mcp get [name]`


## Alternative Configuration Method

Claude Code's default approach for configuring MCP tools is through a CLI wizard (claude mcp add), but you can also directly edit the config file located at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS.
Perfect! Now I know what to do. Let me install the Claude CLI tool for you:
Install Claude CLI globally

npm error A complete log of this run can be found in: /Users/jpw/.npm/_logs/2025-10-20T01_21_58_873Z-debug-0.log
We have permission issues. Let me try a better approach - use npx instead (which doesn't require global installation), or fix npm permissions:
Try using Claude CLI via npx
IN
npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code --version
OUT
2.0.22 (Claude Code)
npm warn exec The following package was not found and will be installed: @anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.0.22
Perfect! We can use npx instead of installing globally. Now let's add the Notion MCP server:
Add Notion MCP server to Claude Code
IN
npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code mcp add --transport http notion https://mcp.notion.com/mcp
OUT
Added HTTP MCP server notion with URL: https://mcp.notion.com/mcp to local config
File modified: /Users/jpw/.claude.json [project: /Users/jpw/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Code&Scripts/vscode-Jeff-Willett/Florida]
Excellent! The Notion MCP server has been added! It modified /Users/jpw/.claude.json. Let me check what was added:
Perfect! I can see the Notion MCP server has been added to your project configuration at lines 19-23! Now let's restart VSCode or reload the window so Claude Code picks up this configuration.
Update Todos

Add Notion MCP server to Claude Code configuration

Verify Notion MCP connection is working

Test reading from Notion 'Tasks & Action Items' database

Test writing to Notion database
Excellent! The configuration is saved. Now please restart VSCode (or reload the window):
Press Cmd+Shift+P
Type: Developer: Reload Window
Press Enter
After VSCode reloads, please:
Type /mcp again in the Claude Code chat
Tell me what you see
The Notion server should now appear in the list!
i see it now but...
Perfect! I can see the Notion server is listed but it shows "needs-auth" - which means it needs OAuth authorization! Let me click on it to see if there's an authorization button, or let's try to authorize it through the command line:
List MCP servers to check status
IN
npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code mcp list
OUT
Checking MCP server health...

notion: https://mcp.notion.com/mcp (HTTP) - ⚠ Needs authentication
Perfect! Now let's try to authorize the Notion MCP server. Let me try to trigger the OAuth flow:
Try to authorize Notion MCP
IN
npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code mcp authorize notion 2>&1 || echo "If authorize command doesn't exist, we'll try another approach"
OUT
error: unknown command 'authorize'
If authorize command doesn't exist, we'll try another approach
The authorize command doesn't exist. Let me check what happens when we try to click on the "needs-auth" button in the UI. Can you please:
Click on the "needs-auth" button next to "notion" in the /mcp dialog
Tell me what happens - does it open a browser window for OAuth? Or show any prompts?
Alternatively, let me check if there's a way to manually trigger the OAuth flow. Since Notion's hosted MCP uses OAuth, clicking on "needs-auth" should open a browser for authorization.
"needs-auth" button is not clickable
Hmm, the "needs-auth" button isn't clickable. Let me search for how to authorize HTTP MCP servers in Claude Code:
IN
{
  "query": "Claude Code HTTP MCP server OAuth authorization \"needs-auth\" how to authenticate 2025"

OUT
Web search results for query: "Claude Code HTTP MCP server OAuth authorization "needs-auth" how to authenticate 2025"

No links found.

Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about authenticating with the HTTP MCP server using OAuth and handling "needs-auth" scenarios:

The HTTP MCP server supports OAuth 2.0 for authenticating with external APIs. When working with OAuth authentication:

When you attempt to make a request to an OAuth-protected endpoint, the server will return a "needs-auth" error that includes an authorization URL. You need to visit this URL in your browser to complete the OAuth flow.

After authorizing, the server stores the tokens and automatically uses them for subsequent requests to that API.

The typical workflow is:
1. Try to make an API request through the MCP server
2. Receive a "needs-auth" error with an authorization URL
3. Open the authorization URL in your browser
4. Complete the OAuth consent flow
5. The tokens are stored and future requests will be authenticated automatically

This is particularly relevant when using Claude Desktop or other MCP clients that integrate with the HTTP MCP server for making authenticated API calls to services that require OAuth 2.0 authorization.
Based on the search results, I think the OAuth flow needs to be triggered by actually trying to use a Notion tool. Let me check if I have access to Notion tools now and try to use one, which should trigger the OAuth authorization: Let me try to search for available Notion tools to see if they're loaded:
Get details about the Notion MCP server
IN
npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code mcp get notion 2>&1 | head -50
OUT
notion:
  Scope: Local config (private to you in this project)
  Status: ⚠ Needs authentication
  Type: http
  URL: https://mcp.notion.com/mcp

To remove this server, run: claude mcp remove "notion" -s local
I see the issue now. According to the changelog, version 1.0.27 says: "Remote MCP servers (SSE and HTTP) now support OAuth" and "MCP: Press Esc to cancel OAuth authentication flows" (version 1.0.73). The authentication needs to happen when we actually try to use a Notion tool. Let me try a different approach - let me try to @mention the notion server to enable it, and that might trigger the OAuth flow: Actually, based on the research and the "needs-auth" status, the OAuth flow should trigger automatically when I try to use a Notion tool. Let me ask you to try something: Please try typing this in your chat with me:
@notion
This should @-mention the Notion MCP server. According to version 2.0.10 of the changelog: "Enable/disable MCP servers by @mentioning". When you @mention it, it might:
Show a prompt to authorize
Open a browser for OAuth authentication
Enable the server
Can you try typing @notion and tell me what happens? Does it show up in the suggestions? Does clicking on it trigger any authorization flow?
it does not find @notion
I see the issue now! You have TWO different MCP configurations:
VS Code's native MCP (/Users/jpw/Library/Application Support/Code/User/mcp.json) - which you just selected
Claude Code's MCP (~/.claude.json) - which we added via the CLI
They're separate systems! The one in VS Code's mcp.json is for VS Code Copilot, not Claude Code. Let me check if we need to remove the VS Code one and keep only the Claude Code one, or if there's a conflict: The issue is that Claude Code uses its own MCP configuration in ~/.claude.json, not VS Code's mcp.json. Let me try to trigger the OAuth flow manually. First, let me check if there's a way to get the OAuth URL:
IN
{
  "query": "Notion MCP hosted server OAuth authorization URL https://mcp.notion.com how to authenticate manually 2025"

OUT
Web search results for query: "Notion MCP hosted server OAuth authorization URL https://mcp.notion.com how to authenticate manually 2025"

Links: [{"title":"Notion MCP – Getting started – How to connect Notion to your favorite AI tools","url":"https://developers.notion.com/docs/get-started-with-mcp"},{"title":"Notion MCP Example | 🔐 OAuth Callback","url":"https://kriasoft.com/oauth-callback/examples/notion.html"},{"title":"Notion’s hosted MCP server: an inside look","url":"https://www.notion.com/blog/notions-hosted-mcp-server-an-inside-look"},{"title":"Authorization","url":"https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization"},{"title":"GitHub - makenotion/notion-mcp-server: Official Notion MCP Server","url":"https://github.com/makenotion/notion-mcp-server"},{"title":"Notion MCP – Connect Notion to your favorite AI tools","url":"https://developers.notion.com/docs/mcp"},{"title":"Notion MCP Server | MCP Servers · LobeHub","url":"https://lobehub.com/mcp/makenotion-notion-mcp-server"},{"title":"MCP authentication and authorization implementation guide","url":"https://stytch.com/blog/MCP-authentication-and-authorization-guide/"},{"title":"Notions hosted MCP server: an inside look | Notion Engineering Blog | Engineering.fyi","url":"https://www.engineering.fyi/article/notion-s-hosted-mcp-server-an-inside-look"},{"title":"it's need to public auth · Issue #68 · makenotion/notion-mcp-server","url":"https://github.com/makenotion/notion-mcp-server/issues/68"}]

Based on the search results, I found information about Notion's MCP hosted server and how to authenticate. Here's what I learned:

## Notion MCP Hosted Server Authentication

### Connection URL
MCP clients can connect manually to Notion MCP's hosted server using the public URL: https://mcp.notion.com/mcp as a custom connection.

### OAuth Authorization Flow
Users go through a "one-click" OAuth authorization flow to securely connect to the public integration. Users install MCP in their workspace, granting the permissions they have normally in the app to the MCP integration, and after successful connection, the flow redirects back to the tool they were using (like Cursor).

### Manual Authentication Setup

For MCP clients that support custom connections, you can configure them with:

**Connection Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notionMCP": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.notion.com/mcp"]
    }
  }

```

Once configured, you complete the OAuth flow to connect. The MCP server manages sessions and securely stores the API token from the OAuth exchange to authenticate with Notion's public API when users make tool calls.

### Transport Protocols
Notion's hosted MCP server supports streamable HTTP for a delightful OAuth connection experience, and also supports SSE (server-sent events) for compatibility with more clients.

The authentication is primarily handled through OAuth, so there isn't a manual token entry process - instead, you connect through the OAuth flow which opens in a browser for user authorization.
I found it! We need to use mcp-remote wrapper to connect to the hosted Notion MCP. Let me update the configuration:
Remove the current Notion MCP config
IN
npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code mcp remove notion -s local
OUT
Removed MCP server notion from local config
File modified: /Users/jpw/.claude.json [project: /Users/jpw/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Code&Scripts/vscode-Jeff-Willett/Florida]
Good, it's removed. Now let me add it using the stdio method with mcp-remote:
Add Notion MCP with mcp-remote wrapper
IN
npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code mcp add notion -s local -- npx -y mcp-remote https://mcp.notion.com/mcp
OUT
Added stdio MCP server notion with command: npx -y mcp-remote https://mcp.notion.com/mcp to local config
File modified: /Users/jpw/.claude.json [project: /Users/jpw/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Code&Scripts/vscode-Jeff-Willett/Florida]
Excellent! Now let's check the status:
Check MCP server status
IN
npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code mcp list
OUT
Checking MCP server health...

notion: npx -y mcp-remote https://mcp.notion.com/mcp - ✓ Connected
🎉 EXCELLENT! The Notion MCP server is now CONNECTED! Now please restart VSCode one more time (or reload the window):
Press Cmd+Shift+P
Type: Developer: Reload Window
After the reload, I should have access to Notion tools and we can start reading and writing to your "Tasks & Action Items" database!
Update Todos

Add Notion MCP server to Claude Code configuration

Verify Notion MCP connection is working

Test reading from Notion 'Tasks & Action Items' database

Test writing to Notion database
Perfect! The Notion MCP server is configured and connected. Once you reload VSCode, I'll be able to access your Notion "Tasks & Action Items" database!
okay,  try now

Search your Notion workspace
See all task details (Status, Priority, Category, Owner, Due Date, Notes)
Filter and query tasks
Create new tasks
Update existing tasks
Change task status, priority, dates
Add notes to tasks
Your Current Tasks Summary:
18 total tasks in your Florida project
14 Not Started, 1 In Progress, 3 Complete
7 High Priority items
Next critical deadline: Nov 15, 2025 (RV inspection & community monitoring)
How you can use this now: You can ask me questions like:
"Show me all high priority tasks due this month"
"What tasks are assigned to JoJo?"
"What's the status of RV prep tasks?"
"Update task X to In Progress" (and I'll ask for your approval)
The Notion integration is fully working! Would you like me to help you manage these tasks or query specific information from your database?
okay one thing to address before going further.  every time you would try to access notion,  you woudl prompt me to confirm before you did,  i want to have it so that you do not ask me every time you take an actions.  how do we fix this
Great question! This is a permissions issue in Claude Code. You need to add the Notion MCP tools to your allowed tools list so I don't have to ask for permission every time. Let me check your current permissions configuration:
I can see the issue! Line 16 shows "allowedTools": [] - it's empty. We need to add the Notion MCP tools to this list. Here's how to fix this:
Option 1: Use the /permissions command (Easiest)
In the Claude Code chat, type:
/permissions
This will open an interactive menu where you can:
Select "Add allowed tools"
Choose the Notion MCP tools
Save the configuration
Option 2: Use the Command Line
Run this command:
npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code config add allowedTools "notion:*"
This adds all Notion MCP tools (notion:* means all tools from the notion server) to your allowed tools.
Option 3: Manual Edit (If the above don't work)
I can help you edit the .claude.json file directly. We'd change line 16 from:
"allowedTools": [],
to:
"allowedTools": ["notion:*"],
Which option would you like to try? I recommend Option 2 (command line) as it's the most reliable.
i tried option1 and 2.  but go ahead and update with option 3
Perfect! Let me update the .claude.json file to add Notion tools to the allowed tools list:
Perfect! ✅ The configuration has been updated! You can see on line 27 that "allowedTools": ["notion:*"] is now set. Now you need to restart VSCode (or reload the window) for the changes to take effect:
Press Cmd+Shift+P
Type: Developer: Reload Window
Press Enter
After VSCode reloads, I'll be able to access Notion tools without asking for permission every time! Once you've reloaded, let me know and I can test it by querying your Notion database to confirm the permissions are working smoothly.
can you review that file and make sure you have my blanket approval to run all bash commands
Good idea! Let me check the configuration file to add bash permissions as well:
I can see the allowedTools array. Let me update it to add blanket approval for bash commands:
Perfect! ✅ I've added "Bash(*)" to your allowed tools. Now the configuration includes:
"notion:*" - All Notion MCP tools
"Bash(*)" - All bash commands
Common allowed tools patterns you might want to consider: Would you also like me to add blanket approval for:
"Read(*)" - Read any file
"Write(*)" - Write any file
"Edit(*)" - Edit any file
"Glob(*)" - Search for files by pattern
"Grep(*)" - Search file contents
Or would you prefer to keep those requiring permission prompts for safety? After you decide, you'll need to restart VSCode one more time for all these permission changes to take effect.
