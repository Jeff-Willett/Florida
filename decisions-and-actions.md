## 🎯 DECISIONS

### Decisions Made (Status: Decided)

#### 1. Location Strategy: 20+ Miles Inland
**Category:** Location  
**Impact:** High  
**Date Decided:** September 2025  
**Owner:** Both

**Decision:**
Target properties 20+ miles inland from coast (not beachfront/coastal)

**Options Considered:**
- Beachfront/Coastal (0-5 miles)
- Near Coast (5-10 miles)
- Inland (10-20 miles)
- Deep Inland (20+ miles)

**Rationale:**
- Base insurance rates vs 200-400% coastal surcharges
- Lower hurricane wind damage exposure
- Annual insurance savings: $2,000-4,000+
- Still within 2 hours of parents in Arcadia
- Significantly reduces overall housing costs

---

#### 2. RV Sale Method: Facebook Marketplace Primary
**Category:** RV Strategy  
**Impact:** High  
**Date Decided:** August 2025  
**Owner:** Both

**Decision:**
Use Facebook Marketplace as primary sale method, with consignment dealers as backup

**Options Considered:**
1. Consignment primary (8-10% commission)
2. Private sale (higher risk, timing uncertainty)
3. Facebook Marketplace (no commission, control)
4. Dealer trade-in (lowest value)

**Rationale:**
- Saves 8-10% commission (~$15,000-19,000 on $160K-190K sale)
- Allows living in RV during transition
- Timeline aligns with March 2026 arrival
- Strong Florida RV market for direct sales
- Consignment backup reduces risk if timing doesn't work

---

#### 3. RV Sale Timing: January-March 2026
**Category:** Timeline  
**Impact:** Medium  
**Date Decided:** August 2025  
**Owner:** Both

**Decision:**
Start listing Journey in January 2026, complete sale by March 2026

**Options Considered:**
1. Fall 2024 (too early, need RV for housing)
2. January-March 2026 (peak season, aligns with move)
3. Spring-Summer 2026 (post-move, lower demand)

**Rationale:**
- Peak RV selling season in Florida (40% increase in buyer activity)
- Spring break preparation drives demand
- Perfect alignment with March 2026 Florida arrival
- Allows time for prep and repairs
- Avoids long-term storage costs

---

#### 4. RV Prep Approach: 5 Essential Tasks
**Category:** RV Strategy  
**Impact:** Low  
**Date Decided:** August 2025  
**Owner:** JoJo

**Decision:**
Focus on 5 specific high-impact prep tasks rather than comprehensive overhaul

**Options Considered:**
1. Comprehensive 6+ task prep list (expensive, diminishing returns)
2. Specific 5 tasks (batteries, generator, brakes, detailing, slide-outs)
3. Minimal inspection-driven prep only

**Rationale:**
- Focus on known Journey issues and buyer concerns
- Manageable scope with clear budget ($2K-5K total)
- Addresses safety-critical systems (brakes, batteries)
- Cosmetic improvements for listing photos (detailing)
- Operational functionality (generator, slide-outs)

**The 5 Essential Tasks:**
1. Replace house and chassis batteries
2. Service generator and address operational issues
3. Complete brake system inspection and service
4. Professional RV detailing (interior/exterior)
5. Inspect and repair slide-out operations

### Decisions Pending (Need Resolution)

#### 1. Property Type Selection
**Category:** Property Type  
**Impact:** High  
**Status:** Revisit Required  
**Deadline:** December 2025  
**Owner:** Both

**Current Direction:**
Focus on quality manufactured homes in 55+ communities (based on October 2025 research findings)

**Options Being Considered:**
1. Manufactured Home in 55+ Community ($160K-230K)
   - Lowest insurance costs ($1,200-2,500/year)
   - Available NOW in budget range
   - Many allow RV parking
   - Well-maintained communities
   - 10-year insurance savings: $12K-15K

2. Modular Home ($200K-250K)
   - Same insurance as stick-built ($2,400-4,000/year)
   - Limited availability in price range
   - REALITY CHECK: Most "modular" in FL are actually manufactured

3. Traditional Stick-Built Home ($250K+)
   - Highest insurance costs ($2,900-7,900/year)
   - Outside budget range for quality options
   - More property options available

4. 55+ Community (any type) ($180K-230K)
   - Amenities included
   - Age restrictions apply
   - Community maintenance
   - HOA fees ($200-400/month typical)

**Critical Finding (October 2025):**
"True modular" homes (factory-built, assembled on-site, treated as stick-built for insurance) are essentially non-existent in the $200-250K Florida market. Most homes marketed as "modular" are actually manufactured homes on permanent foundations, which insurance carriers treat as manufactured homes (HUD code), NOT stick-built.

**Blocking Factor:**
Need to clarify occupancy status (primary vs seasonal) first, as this impacts insurance costs significantly and affects the financial comparison between property types.

**Action Required:**
Update decision in Decision Log once occupancy status is clarified

---

#### 2. Occupancy Status: Primary vs Seasonal Residence
**Category:** Financial  
**Impact:** High  
**Status:** Proposed - CRITICAL DECISION NEEDED  
**Deadline:** December 1, 2025  
**Owner:** Both

**Decision Needed:**
Will the Florida property be a primary residence or seasonal residence?

**Options:**
1. **Primary Residence** (6+ months/year occupancy)
   - Base insurance rates
   - Lower property taxes possible
   - Annual insurance: ~$2,000-3,000

2. **Seasonal Residence** (3-9 months, 60+ days vacant)
   - +50-150% insurance surcharge
   - Annual insurance: ~$3,000-4,500
   - More travel flexibility

**Financial Impact:**
- **Difference: $1,000-2,000/year in insurance costs**
- Over 10 years: $10,000-20,000
- This affects all insurance quotes and property type comparisons

**Why This Matters:**
- Required for getting accurate insurance quotes (January 2026)
- Affects property type decision
- Influences budget planning
- Determines travel flexibility

**Action Required:**
Discuss and decide occupancy pattern by December 1, 2025

---

#### 3. Specific County/City Selection
**Category:** Location  
**Impact:** High  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Deadline:** December 2025  
**Owner:** Both

2. **Manatee County** (Bradenton, Palmetto)
   - Slightly lower prices
   - Good healthcare
   - Central location

3. **Charlotte County** (Punta Gorda, Port Charlotte)
   - Most affordable
   - Growing area
   - Slightly farther from Arcadia

**Factors to Consider:**
- Property availability in budget range
- Insurance rates by specific location
- Distance to quality healthcare
- Proximity to Arcadia (parents)
- Airport access
- Specific communities that allow RV parking

**Current Focus Areas:**
- Bay Indies Resort (Venice) - New construction, 55+

---

#### 4. Budget Allocation Strategy
**Category:** Financial  
**Impact:** High  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Deadline:** December 2025  
**Owner:** Both

**Options Being Considered:**
1. **Max House Budget** ($200-250K)
   - Use most Journey proceeds
   - Less emergency reserve
   - Risk: tight on contingency

2. **Conservative House** ($150-200K)
   - Larger RV fund
   - More emergency reserves
   - Lower monthly carrying costs

3. **Land + Build Strategy** (evaluate further)
   - Raw land + modular/manufactured placement
   - More complexity
   - Potentially better long-term value

4. **Rent Initially** (6-12 months)
   - Larger cash reserves
   - Time to find right property
   - Monthly rental cost vs opportunity cost

**Key Considerations:**
- Journey proceeds: $160K-185K expected
- Replacement RV: ~$100K needed
- Insurance: $3K-5K/year
- Property taxes: varies by county
- HOA fees: $200-400/month if 55+ community

**Action Required:**
Finalize budget allocation once occupancy status and property type decisions are made

#### 5. Replacement RV Selection
**Category:** RV Strategy  
**Impact:** Medium

   - Better fuel economy
   - Easier to park
   - Less living space

2. **Class C** (larger, more amenities)
   - Budget: $90K-110K
   - More comfortable for extended trips
   - Better storage
   - Harder to maneuver

**Decision Timing:**
- Not urgent until after home purchase
