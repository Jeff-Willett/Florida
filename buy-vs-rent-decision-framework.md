# Buy vs Rent Decision Framework
**For JoJo Florida TnT Project**

**Purpose:** Quick evaluation tool to determine if a property is worth buying immediately vs continuing rental strategy

**Last Updated:** October 31, 2025

## üéØ DECISION OVERVIEW

**Default Strategy:** Rent for first year (March 2026 - March 2027)
**Exception:** Buy early if property meets "Great Deal" criteria below

**Financial Context:**
- Rent saves $2,410/month vs buying (based on cash flow model)
- 12-month rental = $28,240 total cost vs $64,150 buying cost
- **Cost to deviate from plan: ~$36,000 in first year**

**Key Question:** Is this property worth $36,000+ in opportunity cost to buy now?

## üßÆ FINANCIAL BREAKEVEN ANALYSIS

Use this calculation to understand true cost vs benefit:

### Property-Specific Calculation

**Example Property: $220,000 home**

**Costs of Buying Now:**
1. Down payment (20%): $44,000
2. Closing costs (3%): $6,600
3. Monthly carrying cost: $2,800
4. Lost rental savings: $2,410/month (vs rent for 12 months = $28,920)
5. **First Year Total Cost: $64,120**

**Benefits of Buying Now:**
1. Equity from down payment: $44,000
2. Appreciation (3%/year): $6,600
3. Mortgage principal paydown: ~$2,500 (year 1)
4. Avoided future price increases: Varies
5. Avoided multiple moves: ~$1,000
6. **First Year Value Gain: $54,100**

**Net Cost/Benefit:** -$10,020 (cost to buy vs rent first year)

### The Key Question:
**"Is this property worth paying $10,000 to own a year earlier?"**

**Consider:**
- What if prices drop 5% in next 6 months? (-$11,000)
- What if you find better property while renting? (Priceless)
- What if this exact property still available in 6 months? ($5,000 saved)
- What if prices rise 5% in next 6 months? (+$11,000)
- What if this is THE perfect property and you'll regret not buying? (Priceless)

## üí° KEY PRINCIPLES

### The Rental Strategy Is Smart - Don't Abandon It Lightly
- Renting saves $2,410/month in carrying costs
- Provides flexibility to find THE RIGHT property
- Allows time to learn the area and communities
- Removes pressure from Journey sale timing
- **Only deviate for truly exceptional opportunities**

### What Makes a Property "Exceptional"?
1. **Price:** 10-15%+ below market
2. **Perfect Fit:** Meets all your criteria (RV parking, location, condition)
3. **Timing:** Journey already sold or sale certain
4. **Confidence:** Both partners excited and confident
5. **Market:** Property won't be available in 3-6 months

### Trust Your Research
You've done extensive analysis on:
- Insurance costs by property type and location

**Don't let FOMO (fear of missing out) override your research and planning.**

### The Right Property Will Come
- Florida market has steady inventory
- Manufactured homes in 55+ communities regularly available
- Your criteria (RV parking, 20+ miles inland) actually narrows field
- Patient buyers get better deals than rushed buyers

## üéØ EXAMPLE SCENARIOS

### Scenario A: üü¢ BUY NOW (95 points)

**Property:** Bay Indies Resort, Venice
- **Price:** $175,000 (comparable recent sales: $210,000 = 17% below)
- **Condition:** New 2024 construction, move-in ready
- **RV Parking:** Private pad, perfect setup
- **Insurance:** Quote received: $1,800/year
- **Community:** Top target, land-owned
- **Timing:** Journey sold for $180K last week

**Scoring:**
- Price (30 pts) + Condition (25 pts) + Insurance (10 pts) + Community (15 pts) + RV Parking (10 pts) + New construction (10 pts) + Land-owned (10 pts) - Lost rental savings (-5 for timing)
- **Total: 95 points** ‚Üí BUY NOW

**Why:** Exceptional price (17% below market), perfect property, timing is right (Journey sold), top target community. This is exactly what you're looking for.

---

### Scenario B: üü° STRONG CONSIDER (75 points)

**Property:** Harbor Isles, North Port
- **Price:** $205,000 (comparable: $220,000 = 7% below)
- **Condition:** 2015 build, good condition, minor updates needed
- **RV Parking:** Good setup, adequate space
- **Insurance:** Quote received: $2,200/year
- **Community:** Secondary target, waterfront
- **Timing:** Journey listed but not sold yet

**Scoring:**
- Price (10 pts) + Condition (15 pts) + Insurance (5 pts) + Community (20 pts includes waterfront) + RV Parking (5 pts) + Motivated seller (5 pts)
- **Total: 75 points** ‚Üí STRONG CONSIDER

**Why:** Good deal but not exceptional. Would need to feel confident Journey will sell quickly, or negotiate price down further. Have serious discussion about whether to commit now or wait.

---

### Scenario C: üî¥ KEEP RENTING (45 points)

**Property:** Southport Springs, Venice
- **Price:** $235,000 (comparable: $240,000 = 2% below)
- **Condition:** 2008 build, needs some updates
- **RV Parking:** Acceptable but tight fit
- **Insurance:** Quote pending (estimated $2,800/year)
- **Community:** Acceptable but not top choice
- **Timing:** Journey not sold yet

**Scoring:**
- Price (0 pts) + Condition (5 pts) + Insurance (0 pts) + Community (5 pts) + RV Parking (0 pts)
- **Total: 45 points** ‚Üí KEEP RENTING

**Why:** Not enough of a deal to justify buying now. At-market pricing, mediocre fit, timing uncertain. Much better to keep renting and find a property scoring 70+.

---

## üìÖ WHEN TO REVISIT THIS FRAMEWORK

**Quarterly Reviews:**
- After 3 months of renting (June 2026)
- After 6 months of renting (September 2026)
- After 9 months of renting (December 2026)
- Before lease renewal (February 2027)

**At Each Review, Ask:**
1. Have we found any properties scoring 70+?
2. Do we understand the area better now?
3. Has our occupancy preference (primary vs seasonal) become clearer?
4. Are market conditions changing (rising/falling prices)?
5. Do we still feel good about the rental strategy?

**Update Scoring Thresholds If:**
- Market conditions change significantly (adjust scoring)
- Your preferences evolve (update weighting)
- Financial situation changes (adjust costs)
- Insurance rates prove higher/lower than expected (adjust expectations)

---

**Remember:** The rental strategy is smart. Only deviate for properties scoring 70+ points that genuinely excite you both. Otherwise, stick to the plan and find THE RIGHT property in your own time.
